## Concluding Evaluation Report

Based on the final analysis of the concluding data, the "original" trading algorithm would be better at predicting the trends.  Over time, the new modified trading algorithm appears to skew farther from the actual returns in its predictions. 

  Based upon the current data, I would conclude that the original algorithm would be the correct prediction model to anticipate the market.
